Team Idea(s):

Version 1 (General Approach) 
Creating an online workspace for [Insert Workspace Type Here], that can be used for [Insert Use Case(s) Here]. This workspace will lead to an increased sense of Sangha (community) enforcing an external trigger on [Insert Group Type]/Participants, allowing them to better achieve their set goals. This platform will facilitate structured, focused work sessions, project related info on demand, promoting productivity and team coordination.

Version 2 (Specific Approach 1: Bolstering Sadhana [daily practices])
Creating an online sadhana space for AOL members and non-members, that can be used for them to join and do their daily practices. This space can be used for daily Kriya, daily meditation, daily chanting and other weekly group sadhana events. This workspace will lead to an increased sense of Sangha (community) enforcing an external trigger on Participants, allowing them to stay consistent with their daily practices. This platform will facilitate AOL teachers, giving them a space to do seva, lead and spread the teachings of Gurudev while fostering/nurturing the AOL community. This will help to further Gurudev’s message of non violence and world peace (putting a smile on everyone's face in the process).

Pain-points (What are the pain points this project aims to solve? Is your project good to have or really address something that is pressing? Be specific!):
There is currently an issue in the AOL community that has been going on for a very long time. After potential new community members take the first course, the retention rate of them staying in the community and doing daily practices is not as high as we would like it to be. 
Most potential new community members don’t manage to stay with their practices for 40 days.
Most potential new community members are supposed to be on email lists, however, for various reasons, they are not able to stay informed about events. This one automated zoom link would be a one stop shop for anyone looking for support to continue their practices. The sangha element will bolster their motivation and allow them to integrate will into the AOL community.
App provides way to look for events
For these reasons and more, we think that this is a pressing issue that should have been taken care of immediately. More resources like this one need to be implemented by AOL leadership. These resources help to grow AOL and spread Gurudev’s message.

Impact (What would the impact metrics be? E.g. Reduces time, increases new enrollments, reduces cost, strengthens devotees, increases trust (mis-information), etc):
Increased flexibility by allowing anyone to join community activities at any time.
Increased program activity by allowing teachers all across North America to follow up from programs remotely without any confusion. 
Improved daily life through the continuation of daily practices that would have otherwise fallen off, individuals will gain the unimaginable benefits of daily sadhana.
Improved motivation joining a potentially large yet diverse group of individuals from different time zones that would support each other in continuing daily sadhana. 
Fosters a sense of community and shared purpose knowing the Sangha is always there to work with and have your back. 
Increased growth of AOL by retaining members who would have stopped after taking the happiness program. These members will gain the benefits of daily practices and then share it with those they think it will benefit.

Quantify Impact (Can you put a number to a metric that can be a measure of a goal for this project. E.g. Reduce time to access right knowledge for a question by 30 minutes):
Increase in retention rate of new members: Once new members feel the power of the practices, they will stick to it and become full fledged members of the AOL community. We can compare the number of people who sign up for courses and cross reference with those who join zoom meetings to calculate a retention rate. I expect at least 25% more retention within the first 6 months due to the ease of access and the sense of community. 
Reduction in time spent coordinating meetings: Reduce the average time spent coordinating volunteer meetings by say 20% within the first two months.
Increase in user engagement and Increase in volunteers feeling a sense of community 30% of volunteers will report feeling a stronger sense of community. Gain in insights about what works. 

AI use-case (Why do you need AI for your project. Can you not use any other existing software (e.g. Power BI or Python Libraries or Spark or other  tools) to do the job?

Session facilitation: AI can help manage the structure of the hourly sessions (e.g., starting the session with a breath exercise, playing themed reels, and prompting for intention setting, work time, and sharing).
*Data extraction and recording: AI can extract and record data from user chats, progress updates, and feedback, providing valuable insights for the project.
*Resource management:AI can provide the group with access to curated material, like relevant documents, based on the type of work being done.
Personalized Reminders: The AI can trigger reminders for the scheduled work sessions, sending volunteers a Whatsapp notification with a link to the Zoom call.

AI is crucial because it automates tasks that would otherwise require manual effort and ensures that the structured work sessions run effectively. Existing software such as scheduling tools can't provide the same level of structure, content curation and AI assisted support.

Team Milestones (Imagine you do two 3 minutes demos for next two or 3 months - What would that be on?):
Phase 1: Demonstrate the basic functionality of the platform, including session setup, Zoom integration, and basic data capture.
Phase 2: Demonstrate the basic functionality of the platform, including session setup, Zoom integration, and basic data capture.
Phase 3: Showcase the full functionality of the platform with user profiles, the tracking of progress, a curated document repository, and different types of collaborative workspace.

Data (What sources of data (Art of Living or otherwise) would you use?):
Data from the Art of Living community.
User-generated data: project information, user preferences, feedback, and zoom logs.
Publicly available Gurudev’s content for the 'themed reel' section in the beginning of each section. 
Personal data that we would be able to gather and log from the zoom sessions

Data access (Do you have access to data through any APIs?)
Yes. APIs will be used to access Art of Living data and for connecting with other services. User-generated data will be stored in a database within the application.

AI needs (Do you plan to use an existing AI application as is or do you plan to deep dive and tinker with it?):
The team plans to tinker with existing AI models to tailor them to specific project needs such as natural language processing for data extraction and curated content for a document repository. Notebook LLM looks good for this. 

Resources (What resources would your Team need - Think people (PMs, AI engineers, etc), Think GPUs or machines for training (if you are working deeply with AI models), Access to data, etc):
*   Project manager
*   AI engineers
*   Automation developers
*   Cloud infrastructure for database and application hosting
*   Access to APIs for relevant data sources
*   GPUs/machines for training models (if deep dives into AI become necessary)


First task (What would your first real task be beyond ideation or making plans? You have to be hands-on with data in the first task you choose. Be specific!):
Develop a basic database structure for the platform and implement the core functionality of the scheduled hourly work session. This will involve creating a schedule that teachers and members can sign up to use to have regular weekly/daily activities. These activities will be provided to any who are interested and they will include sessions led by teachers for daily kriya, yoga, meditation, chanting, knowledge sessions and more.

If the tasks were on an hourly schedule, they would look like this:
5 minutes onboarding period, allow late comers to join (sessions start at xx:05 always for consistency where teachers and members can interact) 
30-45 minute block for the actual activity (this depends on what the activity is)
10-25 minutes block where the teacher can choose to engage, read knowledge, chat about experience, etc. Used as a runnover period for longer activities.
