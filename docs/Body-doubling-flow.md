Below is the updated design using **Camunda forms**, **WebSocket alerts in Zoom sessions**, and **Zoom chat/notes** for user input, with **WhatsApp** for pre- and post-session communication. It includes two back-to-back 20-minute Pomodoro sessions within a 60-minute session, with adjusted timings.

# PowerHour

## Platform Concept
**PowerHour** is a virtual body doubling platform orchestrated by **Camunda**, integrating **Zoom** for video, **WhatsApp** for reminders, and an **AI bot coach** for an enhanced experience. It features hourly sessions with two 20-minute focus blocks.

- **Session Structure (Total: 60 minutes)**:
  - **0:00–0:05**: Entry window (5 mins)
  - **0:05–0:07**: Orientation (2 mins)
  - **0:07–0:09**: Goal setting (2 mins)
  - **0:09–0:29**: First Pomodoro session (20 mins, halfway alert at 10 mins)
  - **0:29–0:49**: Second Pomodoro session (20 mins, halfway alert at 10 mins)
  - **0:49–0:54**: Feedback breakout rooms (5 mins, minimized)
  - **0:54–0:60**: Wrap-up and exit (6 mins, adjusted)

- **Key Adjustments**:
  - Two 20-minute Pomodoro sessions instead of one 25-minute session.
  - Feedback reduced to 5 minutes; orientation and goal setting streamlined.
  - No custom UI—relies on Zoom chat/notes, WebSocket alerts, and Camunda forms.

## Technology Stack
1. **Camunda**: Workflow orchestration with BPMN and basic forms.
2. **Zoom API**: Video sessions, breakout rooms, and chat for input/alerts.
3. **WhatsApp Business API**: Pre/post-session reminders and summaries.
4. **AI API (e.g., OpenAI)**: Bot coach for orientation, prompts, and mood analysis.
5. **WebSocket**: Real-time alerts in Zoom (e.g., halfway check-ins, bot coach messages).
6. **Back-End**: Node.js with Express.js for API integration and Camunda process handling.

## Workflow Design with Camunda
Camunda’s BPMN engine manages the timeline and integrates Zoom, WhatsApp, and AI functionalities.

### BPMN Process Outline
1. **Start Event**: Triggers hourly (e.g., 1:00 PM PST) via timer.
   ```xml
   <bpmn:startEvent id="StartHourlySession">
     <bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
       <bpmn:timeCycle>R/PT1H</bpmn:timeCycle>
     </bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
   </bpmn:startEvent>
   ```

2. **Entry Window (5 mins)**:
   - **Task**: Camunda calls Zoom API to create a meeting (`POST /meetings`), sends link via WhatsApp API (`POST /messages`).
     - Example: “FocusSync session at 1:00 PM: [Zoom link]. Join in 5 mins!”
   - Users join common area; locks at 5 mins (timeout event).

3. **Orientation (2 mins)**:
   - **Service Task**: AI bot (OpenAI API) posts welcome message to Zoom chat via Zoom API (`POST /meetings/{id}/chat`).
     - Example: “Hi all! I’m your bot coach. Two 20-min sessions ahead—set goals next. Let’s do this!”
   - WebSocket sends alert: “Orientation started.”

4. **Goal Setting (2 mins)**:
   - **User Task**: Users type goals in Zoom chat (e.g., “Goal: Finish email draft”).
   - Camunda webhook captures chat input via Zoom API (`GET /meetings/{id}/chat`).
   - AI bot suggests refinements: “Try ‘Draft email intro’ for clarity.”

5. **First Pomodoro Session (20 mins)**:
   - **Service Task**: Camunda triggers Zoom to stay in common area or assign breakout rooms (8-person or 1:1 via `PUT /meetings/{id}/breakout`).
   - **Timer**: WebSocket sends start alert: “First 20-min session begins now!”
   - **Halfway Alert (10 mins)**: WebSocket posts: “10 mins in—how’s your focus? Reply 1-5.”
     - Users respond (e.g., “3”); AI bot replies: “Halfway there—keep it up!”
   - **End**: WebSocket alert: “First session done!”

6. **Second Pomodoro Session (20 mins)**:
   - **Service Task**: Same as above, no break between sessions.
   - **Halfway Alert (10 mins)**: WebSocket: “10 mins in—focus check: 1-5?”
     - AI bot: “4? Nice—push through!”
   - **End**: WebSocket: “Second session complete!”

7. **Feedback Breakout Rooms (5 mins)**:
   - **Service Task**: Zoom API randomly pairs users into breakout rooms (1:1 or 8-person).
   - WebSocket alert: “5-min feedback: Share what you did!”
   - Users type in chat/notes; AI bot prompts: “What worked? Any challenges?”

8. **Wrap-Up (6 mins)**:
   - **Service Task**: Return to common area, AI bot posts summary: “Great work! Goals met: X.”
   - WhatsApp API sends recap: “You finished X goals! Next session: 2:00 PM.”
   - Camunda ends Zoom meeting (`DELETE /meetings/{id}`).

### Camunda Integration Points
- **Zoom API**: Creates meetings, manages breakouts, posts chat messages, retrieves input.
- **WhatsApp API**: Sends reminders (`POST /messages`) and summaries; no in-session use.
- **AI API**: Generates bot coach messages (e.g., `POST /completions` with prompt: “Encourage a user at halfway point”).
- **WebSocket**: Pushes real-time alerts to Zoom (via Socket.IO integrated with Zoom’s chat).

## Enhanced Experience with AI Bot Coach
The AI bot enhances the session:
- **Orientation**: Tailored welcomes (e.g., “Back for more, John? Let’s crush it!”).
- **Goal Setting**: Parses chat input, suggests refinements.
- **Halfway Check-ins**: Analyzes mood scores (1-5), offers tips (e.g., “2? Try a quick stretch”).
- **Feedback**: Suggests discussion points in breakout rooms.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up Camunda**:
   - Install Camunda Platform 8.
   - Model BPMN in Camunda Modeler with timers and service tasks (e.g., `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT20M</bpmn:timeDuration>`).
   - Deploy process.

2. **Integrate Zoom**:
   - Use Zoom JWT for API access.
   - Node.js scripts for meeting creation, breakout assignments, and chat posting.
     ```javascript
     axios.post('https://api.zoom.us/v2/meetings/{id}/chat', { text: 'First session starts now!' })
     ```

3. **Integrate WhatsApp**:
   - Use WhatsApp Business API (via Twilio).
   - Pre-session reminder:
     ```javascript
     axios.post('https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{id}/Messages.json', { To: userNumber, Body: 'Session soon!' })
     ```
   - Post-session summary via webhook.

4. **Integrate AI API**:
   - OpenAI API for bot coach.
     ```javascript
     axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', { messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Suggest a goal tweak' }] })
     ```

5. **Set Up WebSocket**:
   - Use Socket.IO on Node.js for alerts.
     ```javascript
     io.emit('alert', { message: '10 mins in—focus check!' })
     ```
   - Syncs with Zoom chat API; users see alerts via Zoom client.

6. **Handle User Input**:
   - Zoom chat for goals/mood (e.g., “Goal: Write 300 words” or “Mood: 3”).
   - Camunda captures via Zoom API webhook; stores in process variables.

7. **Test and Deploy**:
   - Test timing and API calls in Camunda Cockpit.
   - Deploy on AWS with Camunda, Node.js, and WebSocket server.

## Sample Zoom Chat Flow (User Perspective)
- **0:05**: “Bot Coach: Welcome! Two 20-min sessions ahead. Set goals in chat now.”
- **0:07**: User: “Goal: Finish presentation slides.” Bot: “Try ‘Draft 3 slides’ for focus.”
- **0:09**: WebSocket: “First 20-min session begins!”
- **0:19**: WebSocket: “10 mins in—focus check: 1-5?” User: “4.” Bot: “Solid—keep it up!”
- **0:29**: WebSocket: “First session done! Second starts now.”
- **0:49**: WebSocket: “Second session complete! Breakout rooms in 5 mins.”
- **0:54**: Bot: “Great work! Goals met: X. See you at 2:00 PM via WhatsApp.”

---

## WhatsApp Role
- **Pre-Session**: “FocusSync at 1:00 PM: [Zoom link]. Join soon!”
- **Post-Session**: “You nailed X goals! Next session: 2:00 PM.”

---

## Conclusion
**FocusSync Enhanced** uses Camunda to automate a 60-minute session with two 20-minute Pomodoros, leveraging Zoom’s chat and breakout rooms, WebSocket for alerts, and WhatsApp for external communication. The AI bot coach adds value without a custom UI, delivering a lean, functional productivity tool for 2025’s remote workers.
